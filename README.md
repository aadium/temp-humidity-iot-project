<H1>IoT Gateway for Data Processing and Upload</H1>

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
This project focuses on building an Internet of Things (IoT) system that includes an IoT gateway for efficient communication, data processing, and management between IoT devices and a central cloud-based platform. The project utilizes Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances for hosting the IoT gateway, and MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) as the messaging protocol for machine-to-machine communication. The MQTT protocol follows a publish/subscribe model, and the project also emphasizes the benefits of this model for decoupling message senders from message receivers.

The project aims to achieve the following key objectives:
<ol>
  <li>
    IoT Gateway: Create a robust IoT gateway that acts as an intermediary between IoT devices, such as sensors and smart devices, and the cloud-based platform or local network.
  </li>
  <li>
    Efficient Data Transmission: Utilize MQTT as the messaging protocol due to its lightweight and efficient nature. MQTT is well-suited for resource-constrained networks with limited bandwidth, making it ideal for IoT data transmission.
  </li>
  <li>
    Reliability and Scalability: Implement MQTT's built-in features to ensure reliability, especially for IoT devices connected over unreliable networks. The protocol's scalability allows it to handle a large number of IoT devices.
  </li>
  <li>
    Security: Leverage modern authentication protocols (e.g., OAuth, TLS1.3) supported by MQTT to ensure secure communication between devices and users.
Automation: Automate the process of data retrieval and upload. Create a scheduled task to periodically run scripts that fetch simulated data and upload it to the cloud.
  </li>
</ol>
